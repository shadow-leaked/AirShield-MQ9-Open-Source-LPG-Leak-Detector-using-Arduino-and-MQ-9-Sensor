### üöÄ Getting Started

1. Power MQ-9 sensor continuously for **24 hours** (first-time burn-in)
2. Upload the sketch from `/Arduino/MQ9_LPG_Detector.ino`
3. Open Serial Monitor at 9600 baud
4. Observe `Ro` calibration value
5. Gas detection begins ‚Äî red LED + buzzer will trigger if LPG > threshold

> For accurate calibration, follow [Calibration Guide](docs/MQ9_Calibration_Guide.md)

### üß† LPG Gas Curve Used

We approximate MQ-9's LPG response with:
- `log10(ppm)` = -2.1 * log10(Rs/Ro) + 0.72

Where:
- `Rs` = sensor resistance in current air
- `Ro` = sensor resistance in clean air
