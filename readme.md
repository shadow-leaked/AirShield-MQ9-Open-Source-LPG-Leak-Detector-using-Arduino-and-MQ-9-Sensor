- ✅ Real-time ppm estimation using Rs/Ro ratio
- ✅ Buzzer + Red LED alert on gas leak
- ✅ Green LED for safe environment
- ✅ Modular, documented, and extendable codebase

### 🚀 Getting Started

1. Power MQ-9 sensor continuously for **24 hours** (first-time burn-in)
2. Upload the sketch from `/Arduino/MQ9_LPG_Detector.ino`
3. Open Serial Monitor at 9600 baud
4. Observe `Ro` calibration value
5. Gas detection begins — red LED + buzzer will trigger if LPG > threshold

> For accurate calibration, follow [Calibration Guide](docs/MQ9_Calibration_Guide.md)

### 🧠 LPG Gas Curve Used

We approximate MQ-9's LPG response with:
- `log10(ppm)` = -2.1 * log10(Rs/Ro) + 0.72

Where:
- `Rs` = sensor resistance in current air
- `Ro` = sensor resistance in clean air
